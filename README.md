# Time Calculator

## Project Description
Simple project to accompany my coding log. I log my coding hours in the format (hours:minutes) and it was getting annoying totalling that time with mental maths.

This calculator serves as a tool to do those mental maths calculations.

## Future additions
- Have 2 modes, 1 is the typical calculator described above, 2 takes a start time and end time and gives the length of time in between.
